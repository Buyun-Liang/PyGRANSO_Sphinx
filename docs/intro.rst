Our Contribution
------------------

1. Build scalable and user-friendly numerical optimization packages for solving general nonconvex,
   nonsmooth, constrained optimization problems. This software package will be distributed and 
   actively maintained for wider community usage. 

2. Perform a computational and theoretical study of constrained deep learning. Current deep learning 
   frameworks, albeit powerful, cannot integrate physical constraints or prior knowledge. This is 
   because the standard software frameworks such as TensorFlow and PyTorch cannot handle constrained 
   problems. The proposed software package will enable a systematic study of the computational and 
   theoretical foundations of constrained deep learning.
